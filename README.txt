README for OpenAI Assistant Python Script
-----------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic familiarity with running Python scripts and using the command line.

Step 1: Install the OpenAI Python Package
- Open your command line interface (CLI).
- Run the following command to install the OpenAI package:

pip install openai


Step 2: Obtain Your OpenAI API Key
- Visit https://beta.openai.com/signup/ to create an OpenAI account and access your API key.
- Once you have your API key, keep it handy for the next step.

Step 3: Set Up Your Environment Variable
- For security reasons, it's best to set your API key as an environment variable. 
- On Windows, use:
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
- On MacOS/Linux, use:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key

- Replace 'your_api_key' with the actual API key.

Step 4: Running the Script
- Save the Python script provided to a file, for example, 'openai_assistant.py'.
- In your CLI, navigate to the directory where your script is saved.
- Run the script using Python:

python openai_assistant.py

- Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the assistant.

Note:
- Ensure your internet connection is active while running this script as it needs to connect to OpenAI's servers.
- If you encounter any errors, double-check your API key and installation steps.
